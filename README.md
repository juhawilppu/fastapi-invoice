# invoice-pdf-flux

A small project to explore Kafka and event-driven architecture.

## ðŸ§© Architecture
- `fastapi-producer` â€“ exposes `/events` endpoint and publishes to Kafka
- `consumer` - reads and processes events
- `docker-compose.yml` - runs Kafka and ZooKeeper services

## ðŸš€ Run locally

Start Kafka and ZooKeeper
```
docker compose up -d
```

### Producer

```
cd fastapi-producer
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
alembic upgrade head
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Consumer

```
cd consumer
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python consumer.py
```

## ðŸ§ª Try it out

This will submit 100 events to the queue.

```
for i in {1..100}; do
    curl -X 'POST' \
    'http://localhost:8000/invoices' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
    "order_id": "order-$i",
    "customer_id": "36b22c5c-c6ac-44f7-8b6e-5a5a956fae7b",
    "rows": [
        {
        "id": "bbd50bde-1955-442b-a86d-096bb57458f8",
        "name": "Potato, Yukon Gold",
        "quantity": 143,
        "unit_price": 0.17
        },
        {
        "id": "56c2aa1f-ebc2-4fed-b2ee-576a6bc55aee",
        "name": "Carrot, Imperator",
        "quantity": 203,
        "unit_price": 0.21
        }
    ]
    }'
done
```

```

## ðŸ§  Goal

I've worked with queues such as RabbitMQ and AWS SQS, but Kafka always felt mysterious. This project was my attempt to finally understand what Kafka does.
